### Lab-Pgtbl-reprot

#### Speeding up syscall

Allocate some memory for usyscallpage in allocproc() function.

Then free it in freeproc() function.

#### Print a pagetable

Copy the freewalk function.

Use static int level to remember the depth.

#### Detecting which pages have been accessed

Set PTE_A to (1L << 6) according to the riscV rule.

Use walk to find the address and thus renew the mask.

Be careful to set *pte's PTE_A position to zero.
