#### uthread

~~Actually there's a totally same code in "kernal/swtch.S"~~

If the case is not so extreme, I think it's ok to just store all callee-saved registers at the very begin of the `STACKPAGE`.

But for safety, I created a new struct called `callee_reg` and put it in the first position in struct `thread` so that `0(a0)` refers to one of the callee-register.

#### pthread

We can see that function `get` actually does no change to the information. So there is no need to lock `get`.

So we can just add `lock` and `unlock` respectively at the beginning and end of the `put` function.

#### barrier

Every time `barrier()` was called, we add one to the counter. And when it gets to the target we want, just use `broadcast` and thus release.
